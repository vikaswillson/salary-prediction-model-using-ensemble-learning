# 💼 Salary Prediction Model using Ensemble Learning

This project builds a machine learning model to predict employee salaries using features like **job title, experience, education, industry, and location**, based on a real-world dataset from Kaggle (Adil’s Salary Dataset).

The model leverages **ensemble learning algorithms**, particularly **XGBoost**, along with **Random Forest**, **Gradient Boosting**, and a **Voting Classifier**. Advanced **preprocessing**, **outlier handling**, **SMOTE**, and **hyperparameter tuning** are applied to maximize predictive accuracy.
